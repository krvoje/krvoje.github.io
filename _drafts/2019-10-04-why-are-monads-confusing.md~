For such a simple programming pattern, monads seem to generate a lot
of confusion. With FP-beginners they cause endless discussions and
long explanation sessions. For people who do understand the topic,
"_they immediately lose the ability to explain it to others_". They
can probably even evoke a sense of intellectual elitism being directed
towards the uninitiated, along with the rest of the categorical programming
jargon.

The cause of this is mix-and-match of different
